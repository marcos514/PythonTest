Marcos,

Here's the test:

Every night we receive list of players with their: name, team, status, and points for the day.
We need a function that aggregates points by team, and sorts teams in descending order by total points.
Only active players should be considered for team points calculation.

Please:
1) Write the function that accepts the list as parameter and returns another list containing the information in the description.
2) Write at lest 1 unit test for the function.

Thanks,
